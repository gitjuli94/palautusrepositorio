# Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel
This retrospective technique divides the project iteration in 5 categories: start, stop, continue, more of and less of. The idea is to draw a circle in a flip chart paper in the retrospective meeting. The circle is divided into five sections, one for each category. Then the team is asked to openly give feedback from all the categories in the circle, and open comments and are encouraged. The comments are written on the poster for each category.

# Glad, Sad, Mad
The participants are asked to write both good or bad observations on index cards regarding the previous sprint. The comments can also consider actions outside the team members, even external to the project itself, such as finding parking space in the morning. Then the participants describe their index cards and place them on the white board. The white board is divided into 3 columns with titles glad, sad and mad, and the participants choose to place their cards according to how they feel about the issue. Then the issues are grouped if similar ones are placed on the board. Then the participants vote on which of the topics they will discuss further, usually limited to 5 cards (topics). Then the team discusses on the actions that can be performed in the next spring to solve these issues..
